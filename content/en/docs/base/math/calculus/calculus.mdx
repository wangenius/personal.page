## Functions

Monotonicity: When the derivative of a function is greater than 0, the function is strictly increasing

Mathematical expression: When $\frac{df}{dx} > 0$, the function is strictly increasing

### Limits

```math
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = A \Longleftrightarrow \forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, |x - a| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x)-A|<\varepsilon
```

1. $\lim f(x) = A$: The limit exists. The limit at a point has nothing to do with the existence and value of the function value at that point. If the left limit = right limit = the function value at that point, then the function is continuous at that point.
2. $\lim f_+(x) =\lim f_-(x)$: The limit is unique
3. **Removing the hat from equality**: $\lim f(x) = A \Longleftrightarrow f(x) = A + \alpha(x), \lim \alpha(x) = 0$
4. **Removing the hat from inequality**: $A>0 \implies f(x) > 0$
5. **Putting the hat on inequality**: $f(x) \ge 0 \implies A \ge 0$

### Continuity

Composite functions formed by continuous intervals after finite composition are continuous within the domain
The four arithmetic operations of continuous functions are continuous
Basic elementary functions are continuous
Elementary functions are continuous within the definition interval
The inverse function of a continuous monotonic function is still continuous and monotonic in the corresponding interval

### Function Mean Value Theorems

If $f(x)$ is continuous on $[a,b]$:

1. **Boundedness Theorem**: $m\le f(x)\le M$
2. **Extreme Value Theorem**: $\exist a,b \to f(a) = m,  f(b)=M$
3. **Intermediate Value Theorem**: $m\le \mu\le M,\exist \xi\in[a,b]\to f(\xi)=\mu$
4. **Mean Value Theorem**: $x_i\in[a,b], \exist \xi \in [x_1,x_n]\to f(\xi) = (1/n)\sum f(x_i)$
5. **Zero Point Theorem**: $f(a)\cdot f(b) < 0 \implies \exist \xi \in (a,b) \to f(\xi) = 0$

### Multi-level Function Behavior Relationships

1. **Differentiable at a point implies continuous, but continuous does not necessarily imply differentiable**
2. **If left and right derivatives exist (do not need to be equal), it must be continuous. But the derivative at a point cannot determine the monotonicity on the interval (the derivative of one point cannot determine an interval).**
3. **Existence Theorem of Indefinite Integral**: Continuous functions must have primitive functions. The first kind of discontinuity has no primitive function. Infinite discontinuity has no primitive function. Oscillating discontinuity may have primitive functions
4. **Existence Theorem of Definite Integral**: If continuous on a closed interval, it must be integrable. If monotonic on a closed interval, it must be integrable. If bounded on a closed interval, with finite discontinuity points, it is integrable. Integrable functions must be bounded.
5. **If integrable on a closed interval, then the variable upper limit integral function is continuous**
6. **If continuous on a closed interval, then the variable upper limit integral function is differentiable**
7. **Variable limit integral**: If integrable on a closed interval, the variable limit integral is continuous. (If the variable limit integral exists, it must be continuous)
8. **If continuous on a closed interval, the variable limit integral is differentiable.**

## Space and Geometry

### Vector Space

1. **Unit vectors**: $e_X,e_Y,e_Z$: Unit vectors.
2. **Vector representation**: $v = (v_x,v_y,v_z)\quad u=(u_x,u_y,u_z)$: Vectors.
3. **Vector magnitude**: $|v| = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}$: The magnitude of the vector.
4. **Dot product**: $v \cdot u = (v_x,v_y,v_z)\cdot(u_x,u_y,u_z) = v_xu_x+v_yu_y+v_zu_z$
5. **Vector perpendicularity**: $v \bot u \Longleftrightarrow \theta = \pi/2 \Longleftrightarrow v \cdot u = 0 \Longleftrightarrow v_xu_x+v_yu_y+v_zu_z = 0$
6. **Vector dot product**: $v\cdot u = |v||u|\cos \theta \implies \cos \theta = (v\cdot u)/(|v||u|)$
7. $v_i =  v\cdot e_i$: Equal to the dot product of the vector and unit vectors in each direction.
8. $a=\langle v,X \rangle \quad b =\langle v,Y \rangle \quad c = \langle v,Z \rangle$
9. **Direction cosines**: $\cos\alpha=v_x/|v|;\quad\cos\beta=v_y/|v|;\quad\cos\gamma=v_z/|v|$
10. $a = (\cos \alpha,\cos \beta,\cos\gamma)$ The unit vector of vector $v$, representing direction
11. **Projection**: $\Pi_uv = (v\cdot u)/|u| = |v|\cos \theta$
12. $v\times u = \left| \begin{array} {ccc} i & j &k\\v_x&v_y&v_z\\u_x&u_y&u_z \end{array}\right|$
13. $|v \times u| = |v||u|\sin \theta$: The right-hand rule determines the direction, used to calculate normal vectors and area
14. **Mixed product**: $[vuw] = (v\times u)\cdot w =  \left| \begin{array} {ccc} v_x& v_y &v_z\\u_x&u_y&u_z\\w_x&w_y&w_z \end{array}\right|$, if the mixed product = 0, the three vectors are coplanar.

### Field Theory Basics

1. **Hamilton operator**:

```math
\nabla = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x},\frac{\partial}{\partial y},\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right)
```

2. **Directional derivative**: For a ternary function $u=u(x,y,z)$ defined at point $P_0=(x_0,y_0,z_0)$, the distance $t= \sqrt{(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2+(z-z_0)^2}$

```math
\frac{\partial u}{\partial l}|_{P_0} =  \lim_{t\to 0^+}\frac{u(P)-u(P_0)}{t} =\lim_{t\to 0^+}\frac{u(x_0+t\cos \alpha,y_0+t\cos\beta,z_0+t\cos\gamma)-u(P_0)}{t}\\=\nabla u(P_0) \cdot l^o = u_x^{\prime}(P_0)\cos \alpha+u_y^{\prime}(P_0)\cos \beta + u_z^{\prime}(P_0)\cos \gamma = |\nabla||l^o|\cos \theta
```

3. **Gradient**:

```math
\text{grad}\,u|_{P_0} =\nabla u(P_0) = (u_x^{\prime}(P_0),u_y^{\prime}(P_0),u_z^{\prime}(P_0))
```

4. **Divergence**: Vector field: $A(x,y,z) = (P(x,y,z),Q(x,y,z),R(x,y,z))$

```math
\text{div}\,A =\nabla \cdot A = \frac{\partial P}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial Q}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial R}{\partial z}
```

5. **Curl**:

```math
\text{rot}\,A = \nabla\times A = \begin{vmatrix} i & j &k\\\frac{\partial}{\partial x}&\frac{\partial}{\partial y}&\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\\P&Q&R\end{vmatrix}
```

## Variable Independence

1. Independent variables, that is, when one quantity changes, it will not cause changes in other quantities except the dependent variable. Only when a physical quantity is expressed by independent variables can the functional relationship given by it be correct.

2. Non-independent variables, when one quantity changes, it will cause changes in other quantities except the dependent variable. Treating non-independent variables as independent variables is a major taboo in determining the relationship between physical quantities.

Correctly determining whether the physical quantities in the physical expression are constants or variables, independent variables or non-independent variables, is not only the premise and guarantee for correctly answering related questions, but also can simplify the solution process.

In the ideal gas state equation, PV/T=C, where C is a constant. It can be regarded as a constraint relationship g(P,V,T) = C. When one variable changes, it will inevitably cause changes in the other two variables. P, V, T are the three non-independent variables of g.

## Variable Correlation

> Partial differentiation of correlated variables

There is a function $f(x,y) = x + y$. Now the partial derivative of $x$: $\partial f/\partial x= 1$

If we let $x = u, y = u + v$: $\partial f/\partial u = 2$

The current result is somewhat confusing, because $x = u$, so $x$ and $u$ are equivalent, but the results obtained are not the same: $\partial f/\partial x \neq \partial f/\partial u$

This point was introduced in "[Multivariable Calculus 4 - Total Differential and Chain Rule](http://www.cnblogs.com/bigmonkey/p/8350943)". In fact:

```math
\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial u}=1\times1+1\times1=2
```

This requires careful examination of partial derivatives. When calculating $f_x$, it means changing $x$ while keeping $y$ unchanged; while calculating $f_u$ means changing $u$ while keeping $v$ unchanged. Since $x = u$, changing $u$ is the same as changing $x$, but keeping $v$ unchanged is not the same as keeping $y$ unchanged. If $y$ is kept unchanged, because $x = u$, changing $x$ also means changing $u$, so in order to keep $y$ unchanged, $v$ must also change accordingly, so that $y = u + v$ remains unchanged. When $v$ is kept unchanged, $v=y-u=y-x$, it can be seen that keeping $v$ unchanged is actually keeping $y - x$ unchanged, which is different from keeping $y$ unchanged. These partial derivatives seem simple, but they are actually risky to use, because keeping them constant is not obvious.
