# Number

There are three numeric types in Python:

1. int
2. float
3. complex

```python
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
y1 = 35e3 # float
y2 = 12E3 # float
z = 1j   # complex

print(type(z)) # complex

# convert from one type to another
a = float(x)
b = int(y)
c = complex(x)
```

## random

python has a built-in random module

```python
import random

print(random.randrange(1,10));
```
