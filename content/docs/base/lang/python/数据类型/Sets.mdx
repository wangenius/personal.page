# Sets

Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable\*, and unindexed.

```python
myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
```

Sets are written with curly brackets.

Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.

Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.

Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.

> Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items and add new items.

Sets cannot have two items with the same value.

> Note: The values True and 1 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates:

<br />
The values False and 0 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as
duplicates:

```python
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set1 = {"abc", 34, True, 40, "male"}
print(len(thisset))
print(type(set1))
```

```text title="output"
3
<class 'set'>
```

## constructor

```python
thisset = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thisset)
```

## function

### access

You cannot access items in a set by referring to an index or a key.

But you can loop through the set items using a for loop, or ask if a specified value is present in a set, by using the in keyword.

### add

```python
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
thisset.add("orange")
print(thisset)

tropical = {"pineapple", "mango", "papaya"}
thisset.update(tropical)
print(thisset)
```

```text title="output"
{"apple","banana","cherry","orange"}
{"apple","banana","cherry","orange","pineapple","mango","papaya"}
```

The object in the update() method does not have to be a set, it can be any iterable object (tuples, lists, dictionaries etc.).

```python
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
mylist = ["kiwi", "orange"]

thisset.update(mylist)
print(thisset)
```

### remove

```python
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
thisset.remove("banana")
print(thisset)

thisset.discard("banana")
```

:::success Note
If the item to remove does not exist, remove() will raise an error.

If the item to remove does not exist, discard() will NOT raise an error.
:::

You can also use the pop() method to remove an item, but this method will remove a random item, so you cannot be sure what item that gets removed.

The return value of the pop() method is the removed item.

```python
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
x = thisset.pop()
print(x)
print(thisset)
```

```python
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
thisset.clear()
print(thisset)
del thisset
print(thisset)
```

```text title="output"
set()
NameError: name 'thisset' is not defined
```

### loop

```python
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
for x in thisset:
  print(x)
```

### join

There are several ways to join two or more sets in Python.

You can use the union() method that returns a new set containing all items from both sets, or the update() method that inserts all the items from one set into another:

```python
set1 = {"a", "b" , "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}

set3 = set1.union(set2)
print(set3)

set1.update(set2)
print(set1)
```

:::success 注意
Note: Both union() and update() will exclude any duplicate items.
:::

The intersection_update() method will keep only the items that are present in both sets.

The intersection() method will return a new set, that only contains the items that are present in both sets.

```python
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
y = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

z = x.intersection(y)
print(z)

x.intersection_update(y)
print(x)
```

```text title="output"
{"apple"}
{"apple"}
```

The symmetric_difference_update() method will keep only the elements that are NOT present in both sets.

```python
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
y = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

z = x.symmetric_difference(y)
print(z)

x.symmetric_difference_update(y)
print(x)
```

```text title="output"
{'google', 'banana', 'microsoft', 'cherry'}
{'google', 'banana', 'microsoft', 'cherry'}
```

The values True and 1 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates.
