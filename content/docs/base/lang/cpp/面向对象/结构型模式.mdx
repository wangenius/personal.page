# 结构型模式

## 适配器模式

Adapter 将一个类的接口转换成客户希望的另外一个接口，使得原本由于接口不兼容而不能一起工作的那些类能一起工作。

优点
客户端通过适配器可以透明地调用目标接口。
复用了现存的类，程序员不需要修改原有代码而重用现有的适配者类。
将目标类和适配者类解耦，解决了目标类和适配者类接口不一致的问题。
缺点
对类适配器来说，更换适配器的实现过程比较复杂。
应用场景

在现实生活中，经常出现两个对象因接口不兼容而不能在一起工作的实例，这时需要第三者进行适配。例如，讲中文的人同讲英文的人对话时需要一个翻译，用直流电的笔记本电脑接交流电源时需要一个电源适配器，用计算机访问照相机的 SD 内存卡时需要一个读卡器等。
在软件设计中也可能出现：需要开发的具有某种业务功能的组件在现有的组件库中已经存在，但它们与当前系统的接口规范不兼容，如果重新开发这些组件成本又很高，这时用适配器模式能很好地解决这些问题。

```cpp
/**
 * 目标定义了客户端代码使用的领域特定接口。
 */
class Target {
 public:
  virtual ~Target() = default;
  virtual std::string Request() const {
    return "Target: The default target's behavior.";
  }
};

/**
 * 适配器包含一些有用的行为，但其接口与现有的客户端代码不兼容。适配器需要在客户端代码可以使用它之前进行一些适应。
 */
class Adaptee {
 public:
  std::string SpecificRequest() const {
    return ".eetpadA eht fo roivaheb laicepS";
  }
};

/**
 * 适配器使适配器的接口与目标的接口兼容。
 */
class Adapter : public Target {
 private:
  Adaptee *adaptee_;

 public:
  Adapter(Adaptee *adaptee) : adaptee_(adaptee) {}
  std::string Request() const override {
    std::string to_reverse = this->adaptee_->SpecificRequest();
    std::reverse(to_reverse.begin(), to_reverse.end());
    return "Adapter: (TRANSLATED) " + to_reverse;
  }
};

/**
 * The client code supports all classes that follow the Target interface.
 */
void ClientCode(const Target *target) {
  std::cout << target->Request();
}

int main() {
  std::cout << "Client: 默认的对象工作很好：\n";
  Target *target = new Target;
  ClientCode(target);
  std::cout << "\n\n";
  Adaptee *adaptee = new Adaptee;
  std::cout << "Client: The Adaptee class has a weird interface. See, I don't understand it:\n";
  std::cout << "Adaptee: " << adaptee->SpecificRequest();
  std::cout << "\n\n";
  std::cout << "Client: But I can work with it via the Adapter:\n";
  Adapter *adapter = new Adapter(adaptee);
  ClientCode(adapter);

  delete target;
  delete adaptee;
  delete adapter;

  return 0;
}
```

```text title="output"
Client: I can work just fine with the Target objects:
Target: The default target's behavior.

Client: The Adaptee class has a weird interface. See, I don't understand it:
Adaptee: .eetpadA eht fo roivaheb laicepS

Client: But I can work with it via the Adapter:
Adapter: (TRANSLATED) Special behavior of the Adaptee.
```

## 桥接模式

Bridge 将抽象与实现分离，使它们可以独立变化。它是用组合关系代替继承关系来实现，从而降低了抽象和实现这两个可变维度的耦合度。

优点
由于抽象与实现分离，所以扩展能力强；
其实现细节对客户透明。
缺点
要求开发者针对抽象化进行设计与编程
应用场景

在现实生活中，某些类具有两个或多个维度的变化，如图形既可按形状分，又可按颜色分。如何设计类似于 Photoshop 这样的软件，能画不同形状和不同颜色的图形呢？如果用继承方式，m 种形状和 n 种颜色的图形就有 m×n 种，不但对应的子类很多，而且扩展困难。
这样的例子还有很多，如不同颜色和字体的文字、不同品牌和功率的汽车、不同性别和职业的男女、支持不同平台和不同文件格式的媒体播放器等。

```cpp
/**
 * 实现定义了所有实现类的接口。它不必与抽象的接口匹配。事实上，这两个接口可以完全不同。通常，实现接口仅提供原始操作，而抽象根据这些原始操作定义更高级别的操作。
 */

class Implementation {
 public:

    return "ConcreteImplementationB: Here's the result on the platform B.\n";
  }
};

/**
 * The Abstraction defines the interface for the "control" part of the two class
 * hierarchies. It maintains a reference to an object of the Implementation
 * hierarchy and delegates all of the real work to this object.
 */

class Abstraction {
  /**
   * @var Implementation
   */
 protected:
  Implementation* implementation_;

 public:
  Abstraction(Implementation* implementation) : implementation_(implementation) {
  }

  virtual ~Abstraction() {
  }

  virtual std::string Operation() const {
    return "Abstraction: Base operation with:\n" +
           this->implementation_->OperationImplementation();
  }
};
/**

 public:

  }
  std::string Operation() const override {
    return "ExtendedAbstraction: Extended operation with:\n" +
           this->implementation_->OperationImplementation();
  }
};

/**
 * Except for the initialization phase, where an Abstraction object gets linked
 * with a specific Implementation object, the client code should only depend on
 * the Abstraction class. This way the client code can support any abstraction-
 * implementation combination.
 */
void ClientCode(const Abstraction& abstraction) {
  // ...
  std::cout << abstraction.Operation();
  // ...
}
/**
 * The client code should be able to work with any pre-configured abstraction-
 * implementation combination.
 */

int main() {
  Implementation* implementation = new ConcreteImplementationA;
  Abstraction* abstraction = new Abstraction(implementation);
  ClientCode(*abstraction);
  std::cout << std::endl;
  delete implementation;
  delete abstraction;

  implementation = new ConcreteImplementationB;
