## What is an Operating System?

An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware.

## Key Functions

### 1. Process Management
- Process creation and termination
- Process scheduling and dispatching
- Process synchronization and communication
- Deadlock handling

### 2. Memory Management
- Memory allocation and deallocation
- Virtual memory management
- Memory protection
- Paging and segmentation

### 3. File System Management
- File creation, deletion, and modification
- Directory management
- File access control
- Storage space management

### 4. Device Management
- Device allocation and deallocation
- Device drivers
- I/O scheduling
- Buffer management

### 5. Security and Protection
- User authentication
- Access control
- Encryption and decryption
- Security policies

## Types of Operating Systems

### 1. Batch Operating Systems
- Execute jobs in batches
- No user interaction during execution
- Efficient for repetitive tasks

### 2. Time-Sharing Systems
- Multiple users share system resources
- Rapid switching between processes
- Interactive computing

### 3. Distributed Systems
- Multiple computers work together
- Resource sharing across network
- High reliability and scalability

### 4. Real-Time Systems
- Meet strict timing requirements
- Predictable response times
- Used in embedded systems

### 5. Embedded Systems
- Specialized for specific tasks
- Limited resources
- Found in appliances, cars, etc.

## Operating System Components

### 1. Kernel
- Core part of the OS
- Manages system resources
- Provides low-level services

### 2. Shell
- Command-line interface
- Interprets user commands
- Provides scripting capabilities

### 3. File System
- Organizes data storage
- Manages files and directories
- Provides access methods

### 4. User Interface
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- System calls interface

## Process Management

### Process States
- **New**: Process is being created
- **Ready**: Process is ready to execute
- **Running**: Process is executing
- **Waiting**: Process is waiting for an event
- **Terminated**: Process has finished execution

### Process Control Block (PCB)
- Process ID
- Process state
- Program counter
- CPU registers
- Memory management information
- Accounting information
- I/O status information

### Scheduling Algorithms
- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Priority Scheduling**
- **Round Robin**
- **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**

## Memory Management

### Memory Allocation
- **Contiguous Allocation**: Single continuous block
- **Paging**: Divide memory into fixed-size pages
- **Segmentation**: Divide memory into variable-size segments
- **Segmented Paging**: Combination of both

### Virtual Memory
- **Demand Paging**: Load pages as needed
- **Page Replacement Algorithms**:
  - FIFO (First In, First Out)
  - LRU (Least Recently Used)
  - Optimal Page Replacement
  - Clock Algorithm

## File Systems

### File Operations
- Create, delete, read, write
- Open, close, seek
- Rename, copy, move

### Directory Structures
- **Single-level**: All files in one directory
- **Two-level**: Separate directories for each user
- **Tree-structured**: Hierarchical directory structure
- **Acyclic-graph**: Shared subdirectories
- **General-graph**: Full graph structure

### Allocation Methods
- **Contiguous**: Sequential allocation
- **Linked**: Linked list of blocks
- **Indexed**: Index block points to file blocks

## I/O Management

### I/O Hardware
- **Polling**: CPU checks device status
- **Interrupts**: Device interrupts CPU
- **DMA**: Direct Memory Access

### I/O Software Layers
1. **Interrupt Handlers**
2. **Device Drivers**
3. **Device-Independent I/O Software**
4. **User-Space I/O Software**

## Security

### Access Control
- **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**
- **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

### Authentication
- Passwords
- Biometrics
- Multi-factor authentication

## Popular Operating Systems

### Desktop/Server
- **Windows**: Microsoft Windows family
- **macOS**: Apple's operating system
- **Linux**: Open-source Unix-like OS
- **Unix**: Multiuser, multitasking OS

### Mobile
- **Android**: Linux-based mobile OS
- **iOS**: Apple's mobile OS

### Embedded
- **RTOS**: Real-Time Operating Systems
- **Embedded Linux**: Linux for embedded systems
