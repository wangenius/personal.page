“Optimism is an essential ingredient for innovation. How else can the individual welcome change over security, adventure over staying in safe places?”

"The Paris I describe to you could never be objective, because I studied there when I was 25. In truth, the Paris I share with you is my 25."

"The key is not to desperately expect to stage a comeback and then appear glamorously before an imaginary audience. Such non-existent spectators might fuel a short-term sprint, but in the long run, the constant tension will eventually lead to a complete breakdown. Rememeber - the world outside has no others, only your self. And you don't need to prove to anyone what kind of person you are."

"Any suffering as long as you can find the right literature review, is instantly cut in half. Literature defines the boundaries of all knowledges. It can pinpoint what torments you with 10 times the precision of your own words. The moment your name the devil, the devil dissolves. Sort out the logic instead of enduring it."

If you want to live the life you've imagined, start living it now. You can begin with just 20% of it and gradually you'll reach 100%. But if you never start, you will always remain at zero.

If we get back together, it's a tragedy. If we get married it's also a tragedy. If we grow old together that's too is a tragedy. It's the only comedy lies in our complete separation when you think of me and all that follows is a longing reflection and silence.

If you truly understood the workings of cause and effect in this world, you would cease to long for the devoted love of family, a successful marriage, or the comfort of companionship. The conclusion of any personal matter, regardless of its form, is, in itself, a perfect ending.

Fate has spared me with a brief taste.

Remain loyal to your future, not your past.

Confidence is about being open and unapologetic to embrace making a fool of yourself.

Upon reaching adulthood, the first crucial realization is discovering that you can run, acknowledge your limitations in changing circumstances, but recognize your ability to move. When an environment doesn't suit you, you can escape. When people don't align with you, you can walk away. Agile maneuvering allows you to evade most of life's sufferings.

Create a life you can't wait to wake up to.

Buoyancy in the world: just relax and you will be lifted.
