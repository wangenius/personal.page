Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning that studies how an agent should act in an environment to maximize expected cumulative reward. Alongside supervised and unsupervised learning, it is considered a third fundamental paradigm. Unlike supervised learning, RL does not require labeled input–output pairs or explicit corrections for suboptimal actions. Instead, it balances **exploration** (trying unfamiliar actions) and **exploitation** (leveraging known good actions). The exploration–exploitation trade-off is studied extensively in settings such as multi-armed bandits and finite Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).

## Transfer Learning

Transfer learning stores knowledge learned from one task and reuses it for related tasks. For example, features that distinguish cars often help recognize trucks. While the term echoes the concept of “transfer of learning” in psychology, most research in machine learning treats it as a separate, technical topic.
