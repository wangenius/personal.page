Template (search insert position): maintain `left=-1`, `right=n`; loop while `left+1!=right` and shrink via mid.

Applications:

- **`searchInsert`** – After loop, `right` is insertion index.
- **Integer sqrt** – Binary search over `[1, min(x,46341)]` comparing `mid*mid` with `x`.
- **First bad version** – Maintain range of candidates, shrink using API `isBadVersion` until `right` equals first bad.
- **Next greatest letter** – Find smallest letter > target; if none, wrap to first element.

Binary search variations: left-closed/right-open ranges, condition `>=` vs `>` depending on goal. Always guard overflow when computing mid.
