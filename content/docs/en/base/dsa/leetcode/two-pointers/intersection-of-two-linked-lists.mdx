title: Intersection of Two Linked Lists
slug: list-intersection
---

Use two pointers `p` and `q` traversing `A` and `B`. When one reaches the end, redirect it to the other list’s head. If lists intersect, pointers will eventually meet at intersection; if not, both become null simultaneously.

```cpp
ListNode* getIntersectionNode(ListNode* headA, ListNode* headB) {
    if (!headA || !headB) return nullptr;
    ListNode *p = headA, *q = headB;
    while (p != q) {
        p = p ? p->next : headB;
        q = q ? q->next : headA;
    }
    return p;
}
```
