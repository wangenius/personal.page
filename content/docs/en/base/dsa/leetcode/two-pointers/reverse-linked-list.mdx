Iterative two-pointer reversal:

```cpp
ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
    ListNode* prev = nullptr;
    ListNode* cur = head;
    while (cur) {
        ListNode* nxt = cur->next;
        cur->next = prev;
        prev = cur;
        cur = nxt;
    }
    return prev;
}
```

Maintain `prev` (already reversed) and `cur` (current node); flip pointers while advancing. This runs in O(n) time and O(1) space.
