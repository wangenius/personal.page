- **Check balanced tree** – Postorder recursion returns subtree height; if any subtree difference exceeds 1, propagate `-1`.
- **Minimum depth** – DFS downwards; when encountering only one child, continue along existing child.
- **Path sum** – DFS accumulating sum; subtract when backtracking.
- **Lowest common ancestor in BST** – Traverse from root; if both nodes lie on same side, move down; otherwise current root is LCA.

BST-specific tasks often exploit inorder traversal (sorted order) or BST property (less/greater). For general binary tree operations, standard recursion suffices.
