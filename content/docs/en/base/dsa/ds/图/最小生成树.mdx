Given a connected weighted undirected graph, an MST is a spanning tree with minimum total edge weight.

## Prim’s Algorithm

Grow the tree from an arbitrary start vertex:

1. Initialize a min-heap keyed by edge weight (or use arrays).
2. Add the cheapest edge that connects the current tree to an outside vertex.
3. Repeat until all vertices are included.

Works well on dense graphs (O(n²) with adjacency matrix, O(m log n) with heaps).

## Kruskal’s Algorithm

Sort edges by weight and process from smallest to largest:

1. Initialize a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) for vertices.
2. For each edge `(u, v)` in sorted order, add it if `u` and `v` are in different components (no cycle).
3. Stop when `n-1` edges accepted.

Efficient for sparse graphs (O(m log m)).

If all edge weights in every cycle are distinct, the MST is unique.
