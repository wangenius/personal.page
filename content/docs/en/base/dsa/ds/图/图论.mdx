A graph `G = (V, E)` consists of vertices `V` and edges `E`. Graphs may be directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted, simple/multigraphs.

Key terms: degree `d(v)`, in/out degree for digraphs, walks/trails/paths/cycles, connected components, trees, spanning trees, complements, cliques, bipartite graphs.

Properties:

- **Handshake lemma** – Sum of degrees equals twice number of edges (implies an even number of odd-degree vertices).
- **Eulerian trail/circuit** – Uses every edge once; exists iff zero or two odd-degree vertices (undirected case).
- **Hamiltonian path/cycle** – Visits every vertex once; harder to characterize.
- **Bipartite graph** – Vertices can be colored with 2 colors ↔ no odd-length cycles.
- **Strong/weak connectivity** in digraphs; strongly connected components partition the graph.

Special graphs: complete graphs (`K_n`), tournaments, complements, planar graphs. Graph theory underpins traversal, shortest paths, spanning trees, matching, flows, etc.
