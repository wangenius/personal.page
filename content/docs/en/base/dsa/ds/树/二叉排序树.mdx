A binary search tree (BST) satisfies `left < root < right` for every node; inorder traversal yields a sorted sequence. Core operations:

- **Search** – Traverse left/right based on comparison.
- **Insert** – Recursively locate null child and attach; reject duplicates.
- **Delete** – Replace node with successor/predecessor if it has two children; otherwise splice out leaf/one-child node.

### Balanced BSTs

- **AVL tree** – Maintains height balance factor `|height(left) - height(right)| ≤ 1`. After insert/delete, perform rotations to restore balance.
- **Red–Black tree** – Stores a color bit per node, enforcing: each node is red or black, root is black, red nodes have black children, and every root-to-leaf path has the same number of black nodes. Insert/delete fixups recolor and rotate nodes. RBTs are widely used in STL/Java `TreeMap`.

Balanced trees provide O(log n) search/insert/delete, while naive BSTs can degrade to O(n) if inputs are sorted.
