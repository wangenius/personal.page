A Huffman tree is a weighted binary tree used for optimal prefix coding. Properties:

- Nodes carry weights (frequencies); larger weights are closer to the root.
- The tree minimizes the weighted path length (WPL) among all binary trees with the same leaves.
- Construction: repeatedly pick two smallest-weight trees, merge them into a new node whose weight is the sum, and insert back until one tree remains.
- For `n` symbols, the Huffman tree has `2n-1` nodes and no degree-1 nodes.

**Huffman coding** assigns binary codes by labeling left edges `0`, right edges `1`. Codes are prefix-free (no code is a prefix of another), enabling instantaneous decoding. Shorter codes are given to frequent symbols.
