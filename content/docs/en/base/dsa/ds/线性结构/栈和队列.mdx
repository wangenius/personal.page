Stacks (LIFO) and queues (FIFO) can be implemented with arrays (sequential) or linked lists (linked). Use arrays for better cache locality; use lists when dynamic resizing and O(1) inserts/deletes are required.

## Stack

Operations:

```cpp
push(x);    // add to top
pop();      // remove/return top
peek();     // read top without removing
isEmpty();
```

Applications: browser back/forward, undo history, recursive call stacks, expression evaluation. Shared stacks (two stacks growing toward each other) save memory; double-ended stacks enable advanced algorithms.

## Queue

Operations:

```cpp
enqueue(x);   // add to tail
dequeue();    // remove from head
front();
```

Circular queues avoid wasted slots in array implementations; linked queues store `front`/`rear` pointers. Variants include double-ended queues (deque) and priority queues.

Queues model scheduling/order-preserving systems (print jobs, order processing). Two stacks can simulate a queue: push onto stack A for enqueue; to dequeue, move items from A to B when B is empty, then pop from B.
