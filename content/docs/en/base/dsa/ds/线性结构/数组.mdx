Arrays (and C++ `vector`s) store same-type elements in contiguous memory, enabling O(1) random access and excellent cache locality. Trade-offs:

- Inserts/deletes are costly (O(n)) because elements must shift.
- Size is fixed after allocation; resizing requires copying.
- Over-allocation wastes space.

Typical operations:

```cpp
void insert(vector<int>& a, int pos, int x);
void erase(vector<int>& a, int pos);
```

Reverse and rotation can be implemented via three-step reversal.

Applications:

- Lookup tables, DP tables, adjacency matrices.
- Sorting/searching algorithms (quicksort, mergesort, binary search).
- Underlying storage for stacks, queues, heaps, tensors in ML, etc.

Stack vs. heap allocation: both provide contiguous virtual memory, but stack arrays require compile-time size and limited capacity, while heap arrays allow runtime size and larger allocations (at the cost of slower allocation/free).
