title: Control Unit
---

The control unit (CU) orchestrates instruction fetch, decode, execute, I/O coordination, and bus management.

- **Instruction cycle** – Time to fetch and execute one instruction.
- **Machine cycle** – A phase within the instruction cycle (fetch, decode, execute, memory, interrupt).
- **Clock cycle** – Smallest timing quantum (`T = 1/f`).

### Example Micro-operations

```
// Fetch
a) (PC) -> MAR; R <- 1
b) M[MAR] -> MDR; PC <- PC + 1
c) MDR -> IR; decode OP; advance to execute

// Indirect
a) Addr(IR) -> MAR; R <- 1
b) M[MAR] -> MDR; MDR -> Addr(IR)

// Interrupt
a) Save PC to stack/memory
b) Load vector address into PC
c) Disable interrupts
```

### Control Signals

- Status flags (condition codes, interrupt requests).
- Clock signals for synchronization.
- Internal control (register transfers, ALU modes).
- Bus control (memory read/write, I/O commands, DMA handshakes).

### Control Strategies

1. **Synchronous** – One master clock; simple but limited by the slowest micro-operation.
2. **Asynchronous** – Handshaking signals coordinate transfers; complex but tolerant of variable latencies (often used for CPU–I/O traffic).
3. **Hybrid** – Mostly synchronous with asynchronous sections.

### CU Implementations

- **Hardwired control** – Combinational/sequential logic produces control signals directly. Fast but inflexible.
- **Microprogrammed control** – Control store holds microinstructions; a microsequencer fetches them based on the opcode, branch conditions, or next-address fields. Microinstructions can be encoded directly, field-wise, or with mixed schemes; horizontal formats enable parallel control signals, vertical formats are denser but less parallel.

### Pipelining

Time-domain parallelism overlaps instruction stages; spatial parallelism (superscalar) issues multiple instructions per cycle.

Hazards:

- **Structural** – Multiple instructions contend for the same hardware resource.
- **Data (RAW/WAR/WAW)** – Resolve via stalls, register renaming, or forwarding.
- **Control** – Branches disrupt fetch; mitigated by branch prediction and speculative execution.

Advanced techniques include superscalar pipelines, deep (super) pipelining, Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW), and dynamic scheduling.
