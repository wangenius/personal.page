Typical ALU datapath components:

1. **Temporary registers** (user-transparent) that stage operands.
2. **Accumulator (ACC)** for legacy architectures.
3. **General-purpose registers** visible to software.
4. **Program Status Word (PSW)** – condition codes.
5. **ALU** – performs arithmetic/logic operations.

Digital circuits fall into:

- **Combinational logic** – Output depends solely on current inputs.
- **Sequential logic** – Output depends on current inputs plus stored state (flip-flops/latches). CPUs are complex sequential circuits, while the ALU core is combinational.

A classic ALU implementation (e.g., 74181) handles 4-bit operations with built-in carry-lookahead logic; wider ALUs chain multiple slices. Latches buffer operands and capture outputs so the ALU sees stable inputs during computation.
