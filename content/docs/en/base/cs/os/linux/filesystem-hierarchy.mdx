title: Filesystem Hierarchy
---

Linux follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard:

- `/` – Root filesystem; everything branches from here.
- `/bin`, `/sbin` – Essential user and system binaries.
- `/usr` – Read-mostly user space programs and libraries; `/usr/bin`, `/usr/lib`, `/usr/share`.
- `/var` – Variable data such as logs, spool files, caches.
- `/etc` – System configuration files.
- `/home` – Per-user home directories.
- `/tmp` – Temporary files (often cleared on reboot).
- `/dev` – Device nodes (block/character devices).
- `/proc`, `/sys` – Virtual filesystems exposing kernel/runtime info.
- `/boot` – Kernel images and bootloader data.
- `/opt` – Optional add-on software.

Mount additional disks or partitions onto directories within this tree; there are no drive letters.
