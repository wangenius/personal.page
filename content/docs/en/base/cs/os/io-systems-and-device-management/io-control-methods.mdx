1. **Programmed I/O (polling)** – CPU actively polls device status registers until ready, then transfers data under software control. Simple but wastes CPU time.
2. **Interrupt-driven I/O** – CPU issues a request and continues other work; device raises an interrupt when ready. Requires interrupt-handling hardware/software but reduces busy-waiting.
3. **DMA (Direct Memory Access)** – A DMA controller transfers blocks directly between device and memory without CPU involvement. Steps: setup (CPU programs DMA registers), transfer (DMA arbitrates for the bus and moves data, often via cycle stealing), completion interrupt (CPU handles post-processing). Suitable for high-speed devices.
4. **Channel I/O** – Specialized processors (I/O channels) execute channel command words (CCWs) to manage complex I/O operations autonomously. CPU starts/stops channels but does not micromanage transfers.

Cycle stealing: DMA temporarily borrows memory cycles; CPU may be delayed slightly but overall throughput improves compared with polling.
