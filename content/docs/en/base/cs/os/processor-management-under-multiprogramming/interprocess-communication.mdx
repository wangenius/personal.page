## Shared Memory

Fastest IPC method—multiple processes map the same physical memory into their virtual address spaces. Requires explicit synchronization (mutexes/semaphores) because the kernel merely sets up the mapping.

- **Structured sharing** – OS provides a specific shared buffer or data structure (low flexibility).
- **Unstructured sharing** – Processes manage layout themselves inside a shared region (e.g., `mmap`, `shmget`).

## Message Passing

Processes exchange formatted messages stored in kernel-managed queues. Suitable for smaller payloads and naturally supports synchronization.

- **Direct** – Messages sent to a specific recipient’s queue.
- **Indirect (mailboxes/ports)** – Messages routed via named mailboxes that can be shared among multiple senders/receivers.

## Pipes

Unidirectional byte streams backed by a kernel buffer (FIFO). Provide synchronization (writes block when buffer full; reads block when empty) but only half-duplex and not ideal for large data. Named pipes (FIFOs) extend the concept across unrelated processes.
