Routers contain two main subsystems:

1. **Routing Processor** – Exchanges routing information with neighbors, runs routing protocols, and builds the routing table.
2. **Switching Fabric** – Uses the forwarding table to move packets from input ports to the appropriate output ports. Fabrics may be bus-based, crossbars, or shared-memory designs.

### Routing Table vs. Forwarding Table

- **Routing** is the control-plane task of computing paths across many routers. The routing table stores next-hop information learned via routing protocols.
- **Forwarding** is the data-plane task of sending a received packet out the correct port. The forwarding table (FIB) is derived from the routing table and includes the exact output interface plus link-layer information (e.g., next-hop MAC address).
- Routing tables are maintained in software for flexibility; forwarding tables are often implemented in hardware (TCAM) for speed.

### Routing vs. Forwarding

Routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, BGP, etc.) exchange topology information, converge on loop-free paths, and update the routing table on the order of seconds. Forwarding happens per packet at line rate (nanoseconds) using the FIB.

### Autonomous Systems (AS)

An AS is a group of routers under a single administrative domain that share an interior routing protocol (IGP) and a set of metrics. Routers inside an AS must be connected; ASes exchange reachability via exterior protocols (e.g., BGP).

### Routing Algorithms

Desirable properties: correctness, completeness, low computational complexity, adaptability, stability, fairness, and optimality (given the chosen metric). Because the Internet is huge, no router has a global view; instead we rely on distributed algorithms.

#### RIP

Routing Information Protocol is a distance-vector IGP that uses hop count as its metric (maximum 15 hops). Routers periodically share their routing tables with neighbors (“routing by rumor”). Techniques such as split horizon and poison reverse mitigate loops.

#### OSPF/IS-IS

Link-state protocols flood topology information within an area. Every router builds an identical view of the graph and runs Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute shortest paths. OSPF supports areas, multiple metrics (cost), and fast convergence.

#### BGP

The Border Gateway Protocol is the de facto EGP for exchanging routes between ASes. It uses TCP sessions, path attributes, policies, and route aggregation to control interdomain routing.

### Control/Data Separation (SDN)

Software-Defined Networking centralizes routing decisions in a controller while routers/switches handle high-speed forwarding. Controllers expose northbound APIs for applications and southbound protocols (e.g., OpenFlow) to program forwarding devices.
