A computer network connects autonomous computers and peripherals through communication links so they can share resources and exchange information. The global Internet consists of countless heterogeneous networks interconnected by routers.

<Callout type="success" title="What Is a Network?">
You can view a network as an I/O device of a single system. For example, when you type locally but run a program on a remote server, the input travels to the remote host, executes there, and the output returns to you.

## Core Terms

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Data** | The actual information (analog or digital) produced by sources such as computers or sensors. |
| **Signal** | The electrical/electromagnetic representation of data during transmission; can be analog or digital. |
| **Code Unit (Symbol)** | A waveform of fixed duration representing a k-ary digit; `1 baud = 1 symbol per second`. |
| **Source / Sink** | The origin and destination of data. |
| **Channel** | Physical medium that carries signals (wired/wireless, baseband/broadband). Channel capacity defines the maximum achievable data rate. |
| **Data Rate** | Amount of data transmitted per unit time (bit rate or symbol rate). |
| **Bandwidth** | Numerical range of frequencies a channel can pass; for digital signals it corresponds to needed spectrum. |
| **Throughput** | Actual data delivered per unit time. |

## Communication Tasks

1. **Transmission** – Moving bits across a medium.
2. **Routing** – Deciding paths for packets.
3. **Conversion/Relaying** – Bridging different media or protocols (e.g., modems, gateways).

## Common Devices

- **Repeater** – Regenerates and forwards signals at the physical layer; connects identical media segments.
- **Hub** – Multiport repeater; broadcasts frames to all ports.
- **Bridge** – Works at the data-link layer to isolate collision domains based on MAC addresses.
- **Switch** – Multiport bridge that forwards frames via MAC learning.
- **Router** – Network-layer device that forwards packets based on IP addresses.
- **Gateway** – Protocol-conversion device operating above the network layer.

## Transmission Modes

- **Simplex** – One-way communication.
- **Half-duplex** – Both directions but not simultaneously.
- **Full-duplex** – Simultaneous bi-directional communication.

## Circuit vs. Packet Switching

Traditional telephony used circuit switching: a dedicated path reserved for the entire call. The Internet adopts packet switching: data is chopped into packets that are routed independently, enabling statistical multiplexing and efficient resource sharing. Circuit switching is still used for applications requiring guaranteed bandwidth but lacks the dynamic flexibility of packet networks.

## MAC/IP Addresses

- **MAC Address** – 48-bit identifier burned into the NIC (e.g., `00-15-5D-4B-01-FD`). Logical structure: `[Organization (OUI) | NIC-specific bits]`. NICs filter frames by comparing destination MAC with their own address.
- **IP Address** – 32-bit (IPv4) or 128-bit (IPv6) logical address configured for each interface.

## Modulation

- **ASK** – Amplitude Shift Keying.
- **FSK** – Frequency Shift Keying.
- **PSK** – Phase Shift Keying.
- **QAM** – Quadrature Amplitude Modulation; carries multiple bits per symbol by varying amplitude and phase.

## Duplexing Techniques

- **FDM** – Frequency Division Multiplexing.
- **TDM** – Time Division Multiplexing.
- **CDMA** – Code Division Multiple Access, using orthogonal codes.

## Typical Networking Terms

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| LAN | Local Area Network (Ethernet, Wi-Fi in a building/campus). |
| MAN | Metropolitan Area Network. |
| WAN | Wide Area Network connecting cities/countries. |
| SDH/SONET | Synchronous optical transport standards for backbone networks. |
| SDN | Software-Defined Networking: separates the control plane and data plane for centralized programmability. |
