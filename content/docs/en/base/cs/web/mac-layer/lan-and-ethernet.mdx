Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) operates at the data-link layer. Early implementations used bus topologies over coax; modern deployments use twisted-pair star topologies with switches but remain logically a broadcast medium.

## MAC Addresses

Each interface has a globally unique 48-bit MAC address stored in ROM. The first 24 bits are the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) assigned by IEEE; the remaining bits are vendor-defined. If a host has multiple NICs it therefore has multiple MAC addresses.

## Frame Format

```
| Preamble+SFD (8 B) | Dest (6) | Source (6) | Type (2) | Payload (46–1500) | FCS (4) |
```

- Type values: `0x0800` (IPv4), `0x0806` (ARP), `0x86DD` (IPv6).
- CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) governed half-duplex Ethernet; switched full-duplex Ethernet no longer uses CSMA/CD.

## Extending Ethernet

- **Physical layer** – Repeaters/hubs extend distance but share one collision domain.
- **Data-link layer** – Bridges/switches isolate collision domains; VLANs tag frames (802.1Q) so a single switch can host multiple broadcast domains.

## Fast / Gigabit / 10G Ethernet

- **10BASE5/10BASE2** – Thick/thin coax buses (500 m / 185 m segments).
- **100BASE-TX** – 100 Mb/s over twisted pair, star topology, supports half/full duplex.
- **1000BASE-X/T**, **10GBASE** – Gigabit and 10 Gigabit Ethernet; full-duplex fiber or copper, no CSMA/CD.

## WLAN (IEEE 802.11)

Wi-Fi uses CSMA/CA and typically relies on access points (APs). A Basic Service Set (BSS) contains one AP plus wireless stations. Multiple BSSs are connected through a Distribution System (DS) to form an Extended Service Set (ESS). 802.11 frames include up to four address fields to indicate source, destination, transmitter, and receiver roles.
