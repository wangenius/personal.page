title: Hamming Code

A Hamming code adds parity bits to data bits so that single-bit errors can be corrected. For `n` data bits and `k` parity bits, the relationship `2^k ≥ n + k + 1` must hold: `2^k` distinct syndromes cover `n + k` possible error positions plus one “no error” case.

### Construction Steps

1. Compute `k` from `2^k ≥ n + k + 1`.
2. Reserve parity positions at powers of two (`1, 2, 4, 8, …`).
3. Fill remaining positions with data bits.
4. Express each position index in binary; bit `i` of the index determines whether parity bit `Pi` covers that position.
5. For each parity bit, XOR all covered bits to enforce even parity.
6. (Optional) Add an overall parity bit to detect double-bit errors.

Example with data `10101011` (`n = 8`, `k = 4` ⇒ 12-bit code word):

| Position | H12 | H11 | H10 | H9 | H8 | H7 | H6 | H5 | H4 | H3 | H2 | H1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Role | D8 | D7 | D6 | D5 | P4 | D4 | D3 | D2 | P3 | D1 | P2 | P1 |

Parity equations (even parity):

- `P1` covers positions whose least significant bit is 1 → H3, H5, H7, H9, H11.
- `P2` covers positions with second bit = 1 → H3, H6, H7, H10, H11.
- `P3` covers positions with third bit = 1 → H5, H6, H7, H12.
- `P4` covers positions with fourth bit = 1 → H9, H10, H11, H12.

Evaluating the XORs gives `P4P3P2P1 = 0111`, so the transmitted code word is `101001011111`. Adding an overall parity bit (`P5`) yields `0101001011111`.

### Error Detection and Correction

At the receiver, recompute the parity checks:

```
S1 = P1 ⊕ (covered bits)
S2 = P2 ⊕ ...
S3 = P3 ⊕ ...
S4 = P4 ⊕ ...
```

The syndrome `S4S3S2S1` identifies the bit position in error (binary index). A zero syndrome with correct overall parity means “no error.” Nonzero syndrome + failed overall parity ⇒ single-bit error (correctable). Nonzero syndrome + passed overall parity ⇒ multiple-bit error (detected but not correctable).

**Code distance** determines capability:

- `distance ≥ e + 1` detects `e` errors.
- `distance ≥ 2t + 1` corrects `t` errors.
- Standard Hamming code has distance 3 (detects 2 errors, corrects 1). Adding the overall parity bit raises the distance to 4 (detects 3 errors, still corrects 1).
