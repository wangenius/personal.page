Beyond the ALU and control unit, a processor contains caches, interrupt logic, and timing circuits. At its core, a **program counter (PC)** holds the address of the next instruction. The CPU repeatedly fetches the instruction at `PC`, decodes it according to the instruction set architecture (ISA), executes it via data paths (register file, ALU, memory), and updates `PC`.

Typical instruction actions:

- **Load** – Copy a word/byte from memory to a register.
- **Store** – Copy a register to memory.
- **Operate** – Feed register operands to the ALU and write back the result.
- **Jump/branch** – Load a new address into `PC`.

The ISA specifies what each instruction does; the **microarchitecture** defines how it is implemented (pipelines, execution units, etc.).

## Datapaths and Timing

The datapath includes registers, ALUs, buses, PSW, and exception logic. Timing is organized into clock cycles, machine cycles, and pulses. Single-cycle CPUs complete each instruction in one clock; pipelined designs overlap stages.

## Flynn’s Taxonomy

- **SISD** – Single instruction, single data.
- **SIMD** – Single instruction operates on multiple data (vector/SIMD units).
- **MIMD** – Multiple instruction streams execute concurrently (multicore, clusters).

## Multicore and Hardware Threads

- **Multicore** – Multiple physical cores on one chip.
- **Hardware threads / SMT** – Each core exposes multiple logical processors (e.g., Intel Hyper-Threading) so the OS can schedule independent software threads.
- **Software threads** – User-level vs. kernel-level threads managed by libraries or the OS.

## SMP and DMA

Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) shares a unified memory among multiple processors. Direct Memory Access (DMA) engines transfer data between devices and memory without involving the CPU registers.

When a program runs, the shell loads instructions/data from disk into memory, and the CPU executes them. Program output (e.g., printing “hello, world”) is produced by copying bytes from registers to device buffers, which hardware converts into pixels on the screen.
