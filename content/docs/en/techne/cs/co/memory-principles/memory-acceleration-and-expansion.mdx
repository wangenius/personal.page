## Acceleration Techniques

### Dual-Port RAM

Dual-port memories expose two independent sets of address/data/control lines, allowing simultaneous access by (for example) the CPU and a DMA engine. This reduces contention when multiple masters need the same memory bank.

### Multi-bank (Interleaved) Memory

Parallelism can be achieved by splitting memory into identical modules.

1. **Single-module multiword** – Each address stores multiple machine words and returns them in parallel; addresses must be contiguous within the module.
2. **High-order interleaving** – High bits select the bank; low bits address within the bank. Still essentially serial because consecutive addresses stay in the same bank.
3. **Low-order (modulo) interleaving** – Low bits select the bank (`bank = address mod m`), enabling pipeline-style access across banks. If each bank has access time `T` and the bus transfer time per word is `r`, choose at least `m ≥ T / r` banks to keep the pipeline full.

## Expansion Techniques

- **Bit-width expansion** – Connect chips in parallel on the data bus while sharing the same address lines; chip-select controls determine which chips contribute bits of the wider word.
- **Word-depth expansion** – Use additional chips with separate chip-select signals to cover higher address ranges while keeping data width constant.

Chip select methods:

1. **Linear select** – Dedicate an address line to enable a specific chip when the line is 0/1.
2. **Decoder select** – Use a decoder (e.g., 2-to-4) to activate exactly one chip based on high-order address bits.
