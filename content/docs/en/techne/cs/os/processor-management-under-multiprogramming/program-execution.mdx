Compilation pipeline:

1. **Preprocessing** – Macro expansion, header inclusion, comment removal.
2. **Compilation** – Translate to assembly.
3. **Assembly** – Produce object files (`.o`/`.obj`).
4. **Linking** – Combine objects and libraries into an executable (static linking pre-combines everything; dynamic linking resolves symbols at load or run time).

Loading places the executable into memory and performs address relocation (absolute, static, or dynamic). Dynamic relocation relies on hardware (MMU) to map logical to physical addresses at runtime.

## Processes and Threads

- A **process** is an executing program with its own resources (address space, open files, PCB). The PCB stores IDs, register state, scheduling info, and resource bookkeeping.
- A **thread** is the smallest schedulable unit (PC, registers, stack). Threads within the same process share the address space/resources and reduce context-switch overhead.

Thread implementations:

- **Kernel-level threads (KLT)** – Managed by the OS; each can be scheduled on a different CPU/core. Blocking one thread does not block the process but incurs kernel overhead.
- **User-level threads (ULT)** – Managed in user space; fast to switch but if one thread blocks in a system call, the entire process blocks.
- **Hybrid (M:N)** – Maps multiple user threads onto a smaller number of kernel threads.
- **Hardware threads (SMT/Hyper-Threading)** – Architectural support exposing multiple logical CPUs per core.
