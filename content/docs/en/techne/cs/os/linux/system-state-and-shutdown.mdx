Before shutting down a multi-user Linux system, check who is logged in (`who`), active sockets (`netstat -a`), and running processes (`ps -aux`). Notify users via `shutdown` so they can save work.

## Key Commands

- `sync` – Flush buffered data to disk (normally called automatically by reboot/halt/poweroff).
- `shutdown [-h|-r|-k] <time> [message]`
  - `-h` halt/power off; `-r` reboot; `-k` send warning only.
  - Time options: `now`, `+10`, `20:25`, etc. Use `shutdown -c` to cancel.
- `reboot`, `poweroff`, `halt` – Convenience wrappers (invoke `systemctl`).
- `systemctl halt|poweroff|reboot|suspend` – Direct systemd interface.

Always use these commands instead of cutting power to avoid data loss and filesystem corruption.
