title: Directory Layout
---

Linux distributions follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), classifying directories as shareable/unshareable and static/variable. FHS focuses on three top-level trees:

- `/` – Root filesystem; contains boot-critical tools.
- `/usr` – Read-only userland programs/libraries.
- `/var` – Variable runtime data.

### Key Root Subdirectories

- `/bin`, `/sbin` – Essential user and system commands available in single-user mode.
- `/boot` – Kernel images, initramfs, bootloader files.
- `/dev` – Device nodes.
- `/etc` – System configuration (should contain only text configs).
- `/lib`, `/lib64` – Shared libraries required by `/bin` and `/sbin`.
- `/media`, `/mnt` – Mount points for removable and temporary filesystems.
- `/opt` – Third-party add-on packages.
- `/root` – Root user’s home.
- `/run` – Volatile runtime state (tmpfs-backed).
- `/srv` – Service data (e.g., `/srv/www`).
- `/tmp` – Temporary files (world-writable, often cleared on boot).

### Other Important Trees

- `/home` – Regular users’ home directories.
- `/proc`, `/sys` – Virtual filesystems exposing kernel and hardware state.
- `/var` – Logs (`/var/log`), spool files, caches, package databases.

Understanding the hierarchy helps determine where software, configs, and data belong.
