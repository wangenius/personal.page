title: Account and Group Files
---

Linux stores user and group metadata in plain-text files:

- `/etc/passwd` – User database (username, UID, GID, home directory, login shell). Password field usually contains `x` pointing to `/etc/shadow`.
- `/etc/shadow` – Encrypted passwords plus password-aging info (readable only by root).
- `/etc/group` – Group names, GIDs, and member lists.

File permissions rely on the trio of owner/group/others combined with read/write/execute bits.
