`ls -al` outputs permissions, links, owner, group, size, timestamp, and name:

```
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root   19 Oct  4 22:48 .local
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  129 Dec 29  2013 .tcshrc
```

### Permission Bits

Ten characters: `type | owner rwx | group rwx | others rwx`

- Types: `-` regular file, `d` directory, `l` symlink, `b` block device, `c` character device.
- `r` read, `w` write, `x` execute/traverse; `-` means absent.
- Execute on directories allows entering (`cd`).

### Ownership

- **Owner** – User who owns the file.
- **Group** – Group members share the group permissions.
- Link count – number of directory entries pointing to the inode.

### Commands

- `chgrp [-R] <group> file` – Change group (group must exist in `/etc/group`).
- `chown [-R] user[:group] file` – Change owner (user in `/etc/passwd`).
- `chmod` – Change permission bits or special bits (SUID, SGID, sticky).

Timestamps: use `ls -l --full-time` for full precision. Hidden files start with `.`
