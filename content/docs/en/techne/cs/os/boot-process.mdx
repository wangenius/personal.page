(Example uses MBR + legacy BIOS.)

1. **Reset** – CPU begins execution in firmware; BIOS performs POST (power-on self-test) and initializes interrupt vectors/services.
2. **Boot device selection** – BIOS reads the boot sequence from CMOS and loads the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the selected disk (sector 0 ending with signature `0x55AA`).
3. **Partition handoff** – MBR scans the partition table for the active partition and jumps to its Partition Boot Record (PBR, first sector where status byte = `0x80`).
4. **Loader** – The PBR locates and loads the bootloader (e.g., GRUB), which then loads the OS kernel image into memory.

## Kernel Initialization

1. **Loader phase** – Sets up descriptor tables (GDT, IDT), basic page tables, and transfers control to the kernel entry point.
2. **Kernel phase** – Initializes interrupt handling, memory management, scheduler/PCB structures, and the virtual file system (VFS). For Linux, the first user-space process is `/sbin/init` (PID 1).
3. **Kernel threads** – The kthreadd process (PID 2) becomes the ancestor of other kernel threads.
4. **User-space setup** – Init (or systemd) mounts the real root file system, launches drivers and services (networking, display manager), and eventually execs `/bin/login` or a graphical greeter.

Once this sequence completes, the system is ready to accept user logins.
