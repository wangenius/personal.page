| Layer | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| User-level libraries | Provide system-call wrappers and high-level I/O APIs (stdio, C++ streams). |
| Device-independent software | Naming, protection, logical block management, buffering, scheduling, and uniform driver interfaces (supports redirection). |
| Device drivers | Translate abstract requests (`read`, `write`) into device-specific commands and interact with controllers; often implemented as kernel modules. |
| Interrupt handlers | Bottom half servicing device interrupts. |

## Device Allocation

Devices may be exclusive, shared, or virtualized. The OS maintains tables such as the System Device Table (SDT), Device Control Table (DCT), Controller Control Table (COCT), and Channel Control Table (CHCT) to track state and assignments.

## Buffering

Buffers decouple producer/consumer speeds, reduce interrupt frequency, and enable block transfers. Variants: single, double, circular, and buffer pools. Streams may be fully buffered (files), line buffered (`stdout`), or unbuffered (`stderr`).

## Spooling

Simulates dedicated devices via disk-backed queues (input/output “wells”), so low-speed devices like printers can be shared efficiently. Spooler processes manage buffers and move data between disk and devices asynchronously.
