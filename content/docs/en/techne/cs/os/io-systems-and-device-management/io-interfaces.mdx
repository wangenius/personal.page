I/O subsystems comprise hardware interfaces plus driver software that bridge the gap between CPUs and devices (data formats, speeds, control). Interfaces provide buffering, command decoding, and status reporting, often with interrupt request (INTR) and mask registers.

Key components:

1. **Address decoder** – Maps CPU addresses to specific devices/ports (`SEL` signal).
2. **Control logic** – Coordinates timing and handshakes between CPU and device.
3. **Data buffer** – Latches data words/bytes for transfer.
4. **Data-format conversion** – Handles parallel/serial conversion, voltage levels, etc.
5. **Command register** – Receives operation codes from the CPU.
6. **Status register** – Reports device state (ready, busy, errors).

Port addressing may be unified (memory-mapped) or isolated (special I/O instructions).

Devices can be characterized as block vs. character, shared vs. exclusive, synchronous vs. asynchronous, and by bandwidth class (low/medium/high speed).
