A **database** is an organized collection of data managed by a Database Management System (DBMS). DBMS software stores, retrieves, and manipulates data while providing independence between applications and physical storage.

## Data Independence

- **Logical independence** – Changes to the conceptual schema (new attributes, relationships) do not require rewriting applications.
- **Physical independence** – Modifying storage structures or access methods does not affect logical schemas or programs.

## Objects

- **Tables** – Named collections of rows (tuples) and columns (attributes) with defined data types.
- **Rows** – Records; each row should have a **primary key** uniquely identifying it.
- **Schemas** – Define table structure, data types, and constraints.

## DBMS Layers (Three-Schema Architecture)

1. **External (view)** – User/application-specific views of the data.
2. **Conceptual** – Global logical schema representing all data relationships.
3. **Internal** – Physical storage structures and access paths.

## Data Models

- Hierarchical, network (non-relational)
- **Relational** (tables, tuples, domains)
- Object-relational and semi-structured models

Relational algebra operations include selection, projection, join, union, intersection, difference, division, and Cartesian product. Keys (candidate keys, primary keys) uniquely identify tuples.

## RDBMS vs. File Systems

RDBMS separates data from programs, enforces integrity, offers fine-grained sharing, and uses SQL for access. File systems provide coarse-grained file sharing and leave structure management to applications.
