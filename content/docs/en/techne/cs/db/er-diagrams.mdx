Entity–Relationship (ER) diagrams model data using three core concepts:

- **Entities** – Rectangles representing real-world objects (Student, Course, Album). Each entity has instances (rows).
- **Attributes** – Ellipses attached to entities (Name, ID, Class). Key attributes are underlined. Attributes describe properties of entity instances.
- **Relationships** – Diamonds representing associations between entities (Student takes Course, Employee manages Department). Relationships can have their own attributes and cardinalities (1:1, 1:N, M:N).

ERDs provide a logical blueprint that later maps to relational schemas (tables, primary/foreign keys).
