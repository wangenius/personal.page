Network equipment amplifies and forwards signals or interconnects hosts. Some devices merely handle electrical signals, while others make forwarding decisions.

## Adapters / NICs

Network Interface Cards (NICs) connect a computer to the LAN, implement CSMA/CD, and operate at the data-link layer. They include a CPU plus RAM (for buffering) and ROM (for the MAC address and firmware). Responsibilities:

1. Convert between parallel data on the system bus and serial data on the wire.
2. Buffer frames to reconcile bus speed and line speed.
3. Fetch data from memory when the driver requests transmission and raise interrupts upon frame reception.

Because a shared bus delivers every frame to every NIC, Ethernet behaves like a broadcast medium.

## Hubs

Early twisted-pair Ethernet adopted a star topology with a hub at the center. Logically it was still a bus network—only one station could transmit at a time using CSMA/CD.

Characteristics:

- Operates at the physical layer and simply regenerates bits.
- Implements adaptive echo cancellation so transmitted signals do not interfere with received ones.
- Amplifies and retimes each bit before forwarding.

## Switches

Ethernet switches are essentially multiport bridges. A bridge forwards/filters frames based on destination MAC addresses, connecting multiple LAN segments into a larger network while isolating collision domains.

Switch properties:

1. Each port connects to a single host or another switch, typically operating in full-duplex mode.
2. Multiple port pairs can communicate simultaneously, giving each host dedicated bandwidth.
3. Every port forms its own collision domain, so an `N`-port switch provides `N` collision domains.
4. Buffers frames and forwards them via specialized hardware for low latency.
5. Plug-and-play: builds its forwarding (CAM) table automatically through MAC learning.
6. Supports mixed port speeds and eliminates the need for CSMA/CD.
