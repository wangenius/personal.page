title: Media Access Control and Frames
---

The data-link layer delivers network-layer packets across a single link. It frames datagrams, resolves addressing on the local medium, detects errors, and arbitrates access to the shared channel.

## Framing Techniques

1. **Byte Count** – Frame begins with a length field.
2. **Byte-Stuffed Flags** – Special start/end delimiters with escape characters for transparency.
3. **Bit-Stuffed Flags (PPP/HDLC)** – Flag pattern `01111110`; insert a `0` after every run of five `1`s in the payload.
4. **Violating Codes** – Use an invalid line code symbol (e.g., Manchester “high-high”) to mark boundaries.

CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) appends an `r`-bit Frame Check Sequence so the resulting `(m+r)`-bit frame is divisible by a shared generator polynomial. Receivers recompute the polynomial; any nonzero remainder signals corruption.

## MAC Protocols

- **ALOHA** – Nodes transmit immediately and retry after random backoff. Slotted ALOHA improves throughput by aligning transmissions to time slots.
- **CSMA** – Listen before talking.
  - *1-persistent* – Send immediately when idle.
  - *Non-persistent* – If busy, wait a random time before retrying.
  - *p-persistent* – Used with slots; transmit with probability `p`.
- **Token Passing** – Deterministic access (token ring/bus) for high-load scenarios.

### CSMA/CD

Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection was used in classic Ethernet. Stations sense the medium before and during transmission. Collisions must be detected within the **contention window** (2τ). Minimum frame size = `2 × propagation delay × data rate`. After a collision, transmitters send a jamming signal and back off using truncated binary exponential backoff. CSMA/CD only supports half-duplex links.

### CSMA/CA

Wireless LANs cannot detect collisions while transmitting, so 802.11 uses CSMA/CA: distributed coordination function (DCF) with random backoff, optional RTS/CTS handshakes, and Network Allocation Vector (NAV) announcements to avoid conflicts.

## PPP Snapshot

Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) encapsulates network-layer datagrams over serial links.

- Supports synchronous/asynchronous links, full-duplex only.
- Provides framing, CRC-based error detection, and Link Control Protocol (LCP) for negotiation plus Network Control Protocols (NCP) for each network layer (IP, IPX, AppleTalk, etc.).
- No numbering, acknowledgments, or flow control—reliability is delegated to upper layers.
- Frame format: `Flag | Address | Control | Protocol | Payload (0–1500 B) | FCS | Flag`. Byte-oriented links use byte stuffing; synchronous links use bit stuffing.
