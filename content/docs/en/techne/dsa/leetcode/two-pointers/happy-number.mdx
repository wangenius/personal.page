Iteratively replace `n` with sum of squares of its digits. If the process hits 1, number is happy; if it loops, not happy. Detect cycles via Floyd’s tortoise-hare or a hash set.

```cpp
int next(int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    while (n) { int d = n % 10; sum += d * d; n /= 10; }
    return sum;
}

bool isHappy(int n) {
    int slow = n, fast = next(n);
    while (fast != 1 && slow != fast) {
        slow = next(slow);
        fast = next(next(fast));
    }
    return fast == 1;
}
```
