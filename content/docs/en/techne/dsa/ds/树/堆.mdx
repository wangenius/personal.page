Heaps (priority queues) are complete binary trees stored in arrays. For a node at index `i` (1-based), children reside at `2i` and `2i+1`, parent at `i/2`. Two common variants:

- **Max-heap** – Parent ≥ children; top holds the maximum.
- **Min-heap** – Parent ≤ children; top holds the minimum.

## Operations

- **Heapify-down** (`down(i)`) – Compare node with children, swap with larger (max-heap) child until heap property holds.
- **Heapify-up** (`up(i)`) – While node > parent, swap upward.
- **Build heap** – Perform `down(i)` from `n/2` down to 1 in O(n).
- **Push** – Append element, `up(size)`.
- **Pop** – Swap root with last, remove last, `down(1)`.

Heaps support efficient priority queue operations, heap sort (repeated pop), and streaming problems (top-k, median). They contrast with BSTs: no order guarantees across subtrees, but simple array storage and guaranteed O(log n) insert/delete.
