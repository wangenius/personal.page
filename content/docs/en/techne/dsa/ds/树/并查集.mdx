The Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find) structure maintains a collection of disjoint sets and supports:

1. `find(x)` – Return the representative (root) of the set containing `x`.
2. `union(x, y)` – Merge the sets containing `x` and `y`.
3. `connected(x, y)` – Check if two elements share the same root.

Implementation uses a parent array representing a forest; each tree corresponds to a set. Enhancements:

- **Path compression** – During `find`, set each visited node’s parent to the root to flatten the tree.
- **Union by rank/size** – Attach smaller tree under larger to keep depth small.

Time complexity is nearly O(1) amortized (inverse Ackermann). DSU solves connectivity, Kruskal MST, grouping problems, etc. More advanced variants support move/delete or persistence but at higher cost.
