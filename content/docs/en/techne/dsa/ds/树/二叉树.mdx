Trees are acyclic graphs. Selecting a root yields a rooted tree with parent/child relationships (depth, height, ancestors, descendants, subtrees). Binary trees restrict each node to at most two children (`left`, `right`).

## Representations

- **Parent array** – `parent[u]` stores parent index; useful for bottom-up DP.
- **Adjacency lists** – `children[u]` stores all children (vector/list).
- **Left-child/right-sibling** – Store first child and next sibling pointers to convert general trees into binary trees.
- **Binary tree node struct** – `struct TreeNode { int val; TreeNode *left, *right; };`

## Traversal

Recursive traversals:

```cpp
void preorder(TreeNode* root);
void inorder(TreeNode* root);
void postorder(TreeNode* root);
```

Level-order uses a queue. Iterative traversals mimic recursion via stacks.

Full binary trees obey relationships such as `#edges = #nodes - 1`, `height ≈ floor(log2 n)`. Traversal orders define how to serialize/deserialize trees and solve many problems (e.g., reconstruction from preorder+inorder).
