**B-Trees** are balanced multi-way search trees optimized for disk/block access. In an m-ary B-tree:

- Each node stores up to `m-1` keys and `m` children; except root, nodes store at least `ceil(m/2)-1` keys.
- Keys in each node partition the key space (similar to BST). Leaves are at the same depth.
- Insert: add key to leaf; if overflow, split at median and promote to parent. Delete: borrow from siblings or merge nodes to maintain minimum occupancy.

**B+ Trees** extend B-trees:

- Internal nodes store only keys/pointers (no data); all records reside in leaves.
- Leaves are linked in order, enabling efficient range scans.
- Internal nodes have up to `m` keys; leaves have up to `m` pointers/records with minimum `ceil(m/2)`.

B/B+ trees power databases and file systems due to high branching factor (low height) and block-friendly access. Tries (prefix trees) are another family member used for fast string lookups; they organize keys character by character rather than by numeric order.
