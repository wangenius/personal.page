Graphs capture relationships between vertices. We typically store edges in two ways:

## Adjacency Matrix

`adj[u][v] = weight` (1 for unweighted). Pros: O(1) edge existence queries; simple implementation; good for dense graphs. Cons: O(n²) space/time for traversal; wastes space on sparse graphs.

## Adjacency List

`vector<vector<Edge>> adj(n)` where each entry lists outgoing edges from a vertex. Pros: O(n + m) storage; efficient iteration over neighbors; suits sparse graphs. Checking edge existence requires scanning (or sorting + binary search). Variants:

- **Undirected** – Each edge stored twice (u→v and v→u).
- **Directed** – Store only outgoing edges.
- **Extended structures** – Multi-graphs use adjacency multilist; orthogonal lists store separate `in` and `out` chains.

Choose the representation based on graph density and required operations.
