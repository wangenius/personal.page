Linked lists store elements in nodes linked by pointers. Each node typically contains a value and references to next (and optionally previous) nodes.

- **Singly linked list** – Nodes point forward only; suits stacks, queues, hash buckets, adjacency lists.
- **Doubly linked list** – Nodes have `next` and `prev` pointers, allowing O(1) insert/delete given a node but higher memory overhead.
- **Static list** – Implemented atop an array by using indices instead of real pointers.

Concepts: head pointer vs. head node; dummy head simplifies insert/delete logic.

Operations:

- Insert/delete at head or tail in O(1).
- Traverse/lookup in O(n) (use slow/fast pointers to find middle nodes).
- Reverse or rotate list by pointer manipulation.

Lists serve as the foundation for abstract “list” APIs that support dynamic resizing. Standard libraries often provide array-backed dynamic lists (`vector`, `ArrayList`) for better cache locality; choose linked lists when frequent inserts/deletes in the middle outweigh traversal costs (e.g., implementing LRU caches, adjacency sets).
