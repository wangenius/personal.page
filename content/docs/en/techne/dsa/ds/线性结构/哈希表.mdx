Hash tables map keys to buckets via a hash function, enabling average O(1) lookups/inserts when collisions are rare. Performance depends on:

1. Hash function quality (uniform distribution).
2. Table size / load factor.
3. Collision resolution strategy.

Common hash functions: direct addressing, digit analysis, mid-square, modulo (`key % m`).

### Collision Handling

- **Open addressing** – Probe alternative slots when a collision occurs.
  - Linear probing: `index = (index + 1) % m`.
  - Quadratic probing: `index = (index + i^2) % m`.
  - Double hashing: apply a second hash function for step size.
- **Chaining** – Each bucket stores a linked list (or tree) of colliding entries; when buckets grow too large they may be converted to balanced trees (e.g., red-black tree).
- **Overflow area** – Maintain a secondary array for collided entries.

Load factor α = n / m; rehash (resize) the table when α exceeds a threshold to keep operations near O(1).
