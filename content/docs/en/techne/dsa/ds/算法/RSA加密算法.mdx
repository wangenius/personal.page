RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic scheme based on number theory.

1. Pick two large primes `p` and `q`; compute `n = p*q` and Euler’s totient `φ = (p-1)(q-1)`.
2. Choose public exponent `e` such that `1 < e < φ` and `gcd(e, φ) = 1`.
3. Compute private exponent `d` satisfying `e*d ≡ 1 (mod φ)` (modular inverse).
4. Public key: `(n, e)`; Private key: `(n, d)`.

Encryption: `c = m^e mod n`.
Decryption: `m = c^d mod n`.

Security relies on the difficulty of factoring `n` into `p` and `q`. Efficient implementations use modular exponentiation and Chinese Remainder Theorem for speed.
