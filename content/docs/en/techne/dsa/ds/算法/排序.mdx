Sorting arranges data in ascending/descending order. Key considerations:

- **Stability** – Stable algorithms preserve relative order of equal keys (insertion, bubble, merge, counting, radix). Selection, heap, quick, shell are unstable.
- **Time complexity** – Comparison sorts have a lower bound of O(n log n). Non-comparison sorts (counting, radix, bucket) can achieve O(n + k) when value range is limited.
- **Space** – Some algorithms are in-place (O(1) extra), others require auxiliary buffers (merge sort O(n)).

| Algorithm | Avg. Time | Worst | Space | Stable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Insertion | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) | ✔ |
| Shell | ~O(n¹·³) | O(n²) | O(1) | ✖ |
| Bubble | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) | ✔ |
| Quick | O(n log n) | O(n²) | O(log n) | ✖ |
| Selection | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) | ✖ |
| Heap | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(1) | ✖ |
| Merge | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n) | ✔ |
| Counting/Radix | O(n + k) | O(n + k) | O(n + k) | ✔ |

Use-case hints:

- Small or nearly sorted: insertion/bubble.
- General purpose: quicksort (beware worst case), mergesort (stable), heapsort (O(1) space).
- External sorting / large datasets: mergesort, multi-way merge, replacement selection.
- Integers in limited range: counting/radix/bucket sort.
