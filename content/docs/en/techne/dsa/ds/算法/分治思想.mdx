Recursion solves a problem by calling itself on smaller inputs. A recursive function needs:

1. **Base case** – Smallest subproblem with direct answer.
2. **Recursive case** – Reduce problem size and combine results.

Example (merge sort):

```cpp
void merge_sort(vector<int>& a, int l, int r) {
    if (l >= r) return;
    int m = (l + r) / 2;
    merge_sort(a, l, m);
    merge_sort(a, m + 1, r);
    merge(a, l, m, r);
}
```

Divide and conquer formalizes this approach: divide → conquer → combine. Applicable when:

- Problems reduce to smaller subproblems of the same form.
- Subproblems are independent (no overlapping). Otherwise use dynamic programming.
- Combine step efficiently merges sub-results.

Typical algorithms: merge sort, quicksort, binary search, FFT, closest pair. Recursion uses call stack space O(depth); ensure tail recursion elimination/iteration if stack overflow is a concern.
