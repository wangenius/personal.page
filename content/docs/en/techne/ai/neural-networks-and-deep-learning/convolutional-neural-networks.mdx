Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) specialize in grid-like data such as images, audio spectrograms, and videos. Convolutions capture local spatial features with shared weights, drastically reducing the number of parameters compared with fully connected layers.

## Variants

### Standard Convolution

Applies a learnable kernel across the input with stride and padding. Multiple filters form feature maps.

### Dilated (Atrous) Convolution

Inserts gaps between kernel elements to enlarge the receptive field without increasing parameters—useful for segmentation and audio models.

### Transposed Convolution

Also called deconvolution or fractionally strided convolution, it upsamples feature maps, commonly used in decoders and generative models.

### Depthwise-Separable Convolution

Factorizes a convolution into depthwise and pointwise steps to cut computation (e.g., MobileNet).

Dropout randomly disables activations during training, preventing co-adaptation and improving generalization. It can be seen as an inexpensive form of ensembling.
