Deep learning stacks multiple representation-learning layers so that raw data can be transformed into increasingly abstract features. Compared with shallow models, deep networks can approximate complex nonlinear relationships, reuse features across tasks, and leverage massive datasets.

## Bias and Variance

Deep models are expressive (low bias) but prone to overfitting (high variance). Techniques such as regularization, data augmentation, and dropout help strike a balance so the model generalizes well.

## Popular Frameworks

- PaddlePaddle
- TensorFlow
- Caffe
- Theano
- MXNet
- Torch / PyTorch

These frameworks provide automatic differentiation, GPU acceleration, and rich ecosystems for training and deploying deep neural networks.
