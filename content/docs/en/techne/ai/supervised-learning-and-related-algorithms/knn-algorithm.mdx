The k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm is a non-parametric method for classification and regression. To classify a query point, kNN:

1. Computes the distance between the query and every labeled point (Euclidean, cosine, etc.).
2. Finds the `k` closest neighbors.
3. Predicts the majority label (classification) or the average value (regression).

Because kNN stores the entire dataset, it has zero training cost but high inference cost and is sensitive to the choice of `k`, distance metric, and feature scaling.
